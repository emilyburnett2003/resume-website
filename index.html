  <h1 class>About me</h1>
  <p> I am a sophomore at Barnard College studying Computer Science. Outside of school, I love to read and write. My favorite book is Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus, which is being adapted as a TV show currently. I have a dog named Stella. My favorite color is purple. </p>
